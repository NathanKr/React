<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a small sample for using context in hooks via useContext

<h2>Points of interest</h2>
<ul>
<li>i have in this dummy sample 4 levels, only level 4 need language so prop drilling is not the best way , context is much better</li>
<li>i am using semantic-ui-react for using flags and basic styling</li>
</ul>
